## About DENs

The Numerical Ecology Devices (NEDs) focus on the management and analysis of large volumes of digital data from scientific research. These tasks include data collection, processing, analysis, storage and valorization, and are carried out through working groups, trainings, workshops and seminars.

## DEN objectives

The main objectives of the DEN are to establish, coordinate and share technical resources and innovative methodologies to support scientific research. Thus, we facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers.

## “Open Science” Network

DENs promote good practices in data, code and document management, aligning with FAIR principles and legal and funder requirements. Our mission is to guide researchers in the use of tools that facilitate open science and collaboration.

## Data Analytics and Machine Learning Platform

This platform fosters scientific exchange and training in data analytics and machine learning methods, including deep learning. We organize workshops from beginner to advanced level for Marbec members and students to improve themselves in tools such as R, Python, and GIS.

## ScenarioLab

ScenarioLab aims to co-construct ecosystem scenarios with various stakeholders to understand the impact of global changes, such as climate change and fishing activities. We use advanced communication tools and provide training on the use of models developed at Marbec.
